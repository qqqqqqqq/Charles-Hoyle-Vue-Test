# Charles-Hoyle-Vue-Test
I used CLI to create the project, on Ubuntu linux.

Attached 2 folders src and static to go in the project root 
- static contains json files to mock the API calls

I used Axios for the API's : GET for the data requests and a POST for the final booking 
- the POST gives an error but unsure if this was due to environment I've simply logged the POST parameters. (I'm entirely new to VUE, learning it as I go here and felt slightly pressed for time)

I chose to select vehicles for hire quotes and booking from the All Vehicles List rather than the Available Vehicles, as the Availability query only covers single days, and the instructions allowed for either.
